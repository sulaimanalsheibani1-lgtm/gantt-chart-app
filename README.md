# UniProject Gantt Chart

This project provides a basic Gantt chart manager built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to run the application. The UI allows you to manage tasks and export project data.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page that loads the application
- `styles.css` – extracted styles for the interface
- `app.js` – application logic

Feel free to extend the project with additional features or integrate it into your own workflow.
